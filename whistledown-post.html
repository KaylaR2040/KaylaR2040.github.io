            <p><strong>Dearest Reader,</strong></p>
            <p>Whispers are spreading across campus as the much-anticipated Big/Little Day approaches, stirring excitement in the hearts of many. Speculation fills the air, along with the thrill of new connections waiting to be unveiled. Your devoted Lady Whistledown has it on good authority that our sisters are eagerly preparing for the grand reveal, ready to shower their littles with affection and carefully curated baskets.</p>

            <p>But that is not the only thing on the minds of our beloved sisters. Exam season has made its formidable entrance, casting a shadow over the recent fall break. Some took the opportunity for adventure, traveling to faraway places, while others chose the comfort of home, spending precious time with their families. Wherever they went, the break seems to have revived the spirits of our Phi Sigma Rho sisters, just in time for the exciting days ahead.</p>

        <div class="column">
            <p>Despite the busy times, whispers have reached Lady Whistledown that several members of Phi Sigma Rho have been skillfully balancing fun and academic pursuits, all while keeping an eye on the upcoming Big/Little festivities.</p>

            <p>With such a flurry of activity, one can only wonder: who will be matched with whom as the perfect pair? Rest assured, dear sisters, your anonymous correspondent is keeping her ear to the ground and her quill at the ready, for there is much to be revealed soon.</p>

            <p>Until then, I leave you with this: prepare your brightest smiles and thoughtful gifts, for the event of the season is nearly upon us, and soon all will be unveiled!</p>

            <p><strong>Yours in intrigue and admiration,</strong><br><i>Lady Whistledown</i></p>
